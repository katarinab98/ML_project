# Kobe Bryant Shot Prediction Project

# Overview

    Kobe Bryant marked his retirement from the NBA by scoring 60 points in his final game as a Los Angeles Laker on Wednesday, April 12, 2016.
    Drafted into the NBA at the age of 17, Kobe earned the sportâ€™s highest accolades throughout his long career.
